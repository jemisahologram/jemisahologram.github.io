#   Entry 6:

- Recently, I've been sittng in on a handful of meetings (I won't go into too much detail as it involved grants funding stuff specific to the company)

- What's On This Week?
    - Re-meeting with SATheCollective (Singapore) and Punctum (Bendigo)
 and CM to discuss Hi-Viz in greater detail
 - My role will be to get contact details from the artists involved and confirm them to then send out a meaningful question that they can answer so I can create content/promo leading up to the event
    - A voice-note would be fab to create a short sound-clip/animation of the text as a captioning technique but also to make short-form content for Instagram (later could be put together in a compilation of all Hi-Viz 2022 content for future funding applications etc)
    - using a sound snippet from each artist relates to the earlier concepts of Hi-Viz as sound practice as a kind of exchange, and is in the spirit of exchanging knowledge as aural/oral/story-telling is a big part of sharing knowledge across disciplines
