# Entry 5:

- Website re-build
    - wordpress being a bit of a hacky/janky UI to operate the backend
    - issues arising like double-ups of information (each time more info is put on the web, a new place is created from a template)
        - as essentialyly an outsider to the CM universe / a user of the website, my job is to track and critique the UI/UX of the webpage. to do that, I will also need to assess a different web-building tool to create a proto-website to show the team

- Keeping in line with CM's branding/logo (mostly text-based branding identity with a text-based logo and consistine san serif fonts, using logos from supporters,)
    - The main menu and navigation needs a bit of a remix from a UI/UX persepctive, needs to have drop-down features to access information
    - needs some kind of easy to view archive of past works
