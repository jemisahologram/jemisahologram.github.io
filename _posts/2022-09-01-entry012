#   Entry 12:

Internship is almost finito!

What i need to do now:
- Action all of the emails/correspondence with Digital Production team and artists
- collect all of the necessary digital materials:
    - two distinct groups in the program:
        - The Online Group (Friday Only), collect any video/slideshows to test in tech rehearsals
        - The Saturday Group (Saturday Only) who may wish to use audio/video content during workshops and access to any microphones and hi-fi (also good to know so we know where best to put them in the venue)

Next Week:
- Admin Mondays /catchup meeting with the Cm Team
- Tuesday: potentially meet up in Bendigo for a tech run with the Storyland crew to get (online/remote also an option if I can get up there for whatever reason, but I want to go up there and see the control room that I will be in/meet the team!)
