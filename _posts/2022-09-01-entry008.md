#   Entry 8:


So! Hi-Viz social media roll-out to-do:
- editing video from a larger piece of videography documentation from 2019's hi-viz up at the SUBSTATION
    - my job is to create smaller snippets for socials;
        - I made an edit of the original video that didn't include any SUBSTATION moments, just some artist vox pops and one vox pop from the Creative Director about what Hi-Viz and what it means for artists to connect with eachother, particularly for women and non-binary artists making connections with new and existing creative networks
    - closed caption the videos to make them accessible; transcribe exisiting audio in premiere and then time/plot/tweak the position and composition of those captions
