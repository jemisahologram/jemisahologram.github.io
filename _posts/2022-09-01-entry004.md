#   Entry 4:

- first couple of admin mondays were about getting access to the backend of the website, the Dropbox where most necessary credentials are store and used.
    - Accessing the 'archive' of sorts to view/listen to recordings from previous programs (i.e. Hi-Viz 2019), this includes artist talks that I decided to put on Mixcloud (unlimited uploads, unlike soundcloud - and is seperate from CM's existing podcast 'Audiosketch' which is commissioned separately and involves chats with artists)
    - These are more documents/artefacts from previous symposia, why is their distribution important and how do we distribute?
        - We discussed how researchers/students/practioners may want to listen to these stories back, it's adding to the pool of practice-led research in the local arts spaces
        - These aren't productions per sei but could be used to put togther future assemblages of discussion(s) and produced into audio-journalism / podcast format / etc.
