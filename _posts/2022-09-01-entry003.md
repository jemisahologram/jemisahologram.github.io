#   Entry 3:

- Hi-Viz 2022 is aka Hi-Viz Satellites; the two 'satellites' are in Bendigo and Singapore, where simultaneous symposia/events/workshops and artist presentations will be held.
    - My role is to research what the right streaming platform will be for the events; in previous years Zoom Events has been used (in the depths of lockdown). This year, there is potential for Zoom to be used as a platform to unite the two satellites in discussion - chat can be used as an asyncronous space for online audiences to engage / ask questions
        - "Digital Producer" is the name of my role, it will involve moderating the chat, encouraging engagement in the chat and potentially extracting questions from the audience and then relaying them into the discussion
            - Zoom also presents an opportunity to make the sessions accessible to HoH folks, Spotlighting AUSLAN interpreters is also a very useful part of streaming inside this platform
                - Here I'm applying transferable skills as a practioner who also has streamed content / moderated chat spaces extensively in the deeper lockdowns

- I also met with (digitally) the production team in Bendigo to discuss how they will stream on their end and connect with Zoom, we agreed that it was important to make the online space deliberate and engaging whilst also taking care of the audience in Bendigo IRL. 
    - Digital Production/Moderation in the online space is key! Also provides another accessible place for folks who can't make it out to Bendigo AND can view the discussion between the artists/practioners in Singapore discuss sound/practice as exchange/collaboration.
        - CM cross-cultural/timezone collaborations have been important in their programming in an ongoign way

- TO-DO: Create and share a Google sheets that drafts the schedule across Singapore, Bendigo + Online to scope soem choreography around how the online audeince "sees" and engages with the program:
