#   Entry 1: Pre-internship:

-   looking at a list of potential places to intern with my current experiences and interests
    - Liquid Architecture currently on sw pause for internships, will let me know/ I can follow up in the future once some recruitment stuff gets sorted out

-   I applied for a paid internship, I got to the interview round of Marshall Day acoustics
    -   how did the intern-view go?
        - I received feedback that although they did seriously consider hiring me, I was not successful for the position. That's ok! It prompted me to try again (and look to the future to try again should they have any other positions - Acoustics is a really interesting field, and would support my interest in deep listening and a way of turning my sound-skills into a vocation that involves field work and using many transferrable skills)
-   What were the expectations of the internship?
    - Marshall Day were expecting 2 full days a week for 5-6 weeks. This gave me an idea for scope about how to approach/organise an internship at a different company
    -   An unpaid internship would mean the company I chose would have to align pretty strongly with my interests/specialisations
    - I decided to approach Chamber Made (fka Chamber Made Opera) who are known for producing and supporting new performance works that intersect experimental music, theatre, performance-art - as well as symposia higlighting women and non-binary artists working across these mediums.

 - from there, I had two separate phone-meetings with the Execetive Producer and the Creative Director - we discussed in detail what it would mean to come on board as an intern at CM. My main responsibilities would be:
    - researching/delivering a solution for streaming a live-event to take place across timezones/spaces (Bendigo + Singapore) as part of their Hi-Viz program: https://chambermade.org/events/hi-viz-satellites-2022/
    - use coding skills to help with web back and front end
    - Digital Production i.e. moderating the chat in a zoom/whatever platform gets chosen for the streaming event, spotlight relevant speakers during the live-online sessions
