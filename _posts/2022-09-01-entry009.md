#   Entry 9:

Bendigo, here I come!

- I'll be travelling up with the CM team and we will stay in accomodation for two sleeps
    - Night 1 will be the rehearsal day; spotlighting and practising Zoom choreography across the three sites/sets of inputs (Bendigo, Singapore and online)
        - Singapore's signal will be 'one' (their production team will put together all the inputs on their end and then send to us to connect to Zoom)
    - Night 2 will be post Friday's hybrid delivery day; I'll be doing my Zoom duties from a 'control room' on-site)
        - ongoing comms on whatsapp or similar to connect with all of the stage managers irl and url!
    - (head home Saturday)

I'm looking forward to engaging with the public and the surrounds of Bendigo - there's something really special about moving thru localities that have art and music and symposia, I feel v grateful to participate in the workshop day on Saturday too - professional development and networking as an artist has felt so online lately (which don't get me wrong, I do love and got me thru the toughest lockdowns) - but meeting in person gives a bandwidth of emotional scope that I'm very excited for.
