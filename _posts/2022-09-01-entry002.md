#   Entry 2:

- I attended a couple of showings with the Creative Director, these included:

    - Little Operations: Rebecca Bracewell
        - Little Operations is a CM mentorship/residency program that supports an emerging-to-midCareer artist with their performance/sound/music practice; it involves long-term support while the artist develops a new work, with mind to present the new work in a series of showings to the public
        - It's key for me as a practioner and as a maker to see the different kinds of support models for this kind of work; it's important because developing and presenting new works requires a level of support/networks, opportunities for feedback, adding to an ever growing pool of researchers and makers
            - Localised, site-specific makers exploring ideas through performance works

    - Stranger: WIP Progress shoing by Aviva Endean, an artist that has worked extensively with CM and mentored Rebecca Bracewell during their Little Operations.
        - I felt very lucky to be seeing so much mid-career/established/emerging performance works, this showing was an exercise in listening and walking with eachother whilst recording the sounds around us. These sounds found their way into the soundscape towards the end of the piece, whilst also including the ghosts of previous participants' recordings. I made sure to give feedback in the form distributed post-session, I appreciate the practice-led research that the artists were doing and the participatory element - not to mention, walking around Brunswick together to map new site-specific trails and trajectories (taking the work outside of the theatre - or institution, if you will - and encouraging different ways of listening and participating)

- What struck me is the importance of mentorship and collaboration across discipines and getting a scope for the local artists in Narrm is important for me as a practitioner; what kinds of networks and modes of collaborations are happening around me?
